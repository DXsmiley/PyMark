# PyMark Code Judge

Marking student's code is difficult and time consuming, and while there are many code judges online, they are all closed and often difficult to utilise.

PyMark was developed as a response to this. PyMark is (supposedly) easy to setup and is completely open source.

PyMark is coded in Python and is currently only capable of running Python code.

## Current State of Development

You probably shouldn't try using PyMark at the moment. It's undocumented and there's no sandbox, meaning that student's code could do almost anything to your computer. If you really want to, then you can talk to me and I'll write something up.
